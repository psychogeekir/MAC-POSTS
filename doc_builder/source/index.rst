Introduction
------------
      MAC-POSTS is the abbreviation for *Mobility Data Analytics Center - Prediction, Optimization, and Simulation toolkit for Transportation Systems*. It is a mesoscopic traffic simulation library for dynamic network loading. This library is interface based and is friendly to new node/link/routing models.

      The library mainly consists of three parts. One part is called component, which is the separated model such as dynamic node/link model, real-time routing model and so on. Each component has clear interfaces with other components, so we can implement each components with different actual models. Here are the components that we already implemented:

      

      .. hlist::
         :columns: 1

         * Node
         * Link
         * Routing

      The second part is algorithm, the algorithms take the components as input and output corresponding components. The difference between component and algorithm is that usually component comsume memory and algorithm does not (when the algorithm finishes). Here are the algorithms that we already implemented:

      .. hlist::
         :columns: 1

         * All-to-one shortest path
         * Computing SO marginal cost



      By combining different components and algorithms, we can develop complex transportation models. The types of models may vary a lot, and here are the models we implemented:

      .. hlist::
         :columns: 1

         * Dynamic traffic loading
         * Real-time DTA
